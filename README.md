deep learning in ECG classification
Turn one-dimension signal into two-dimension signal and process data in computer vision. 
Built 2D ECG database based on image segmentation and deep neural network. 
Combining with traditional signal processing method and neural network transfer learning to achieve very high signal classification accuracy in real time.
